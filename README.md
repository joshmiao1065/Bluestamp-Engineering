Hey guys! 

I've created a directory containing my sample portfolios for all of your projects when I completed them for the first time. Note that I only uploaded a video for the final milestones that was just a demontration of the base project. 
The code is also well commented for your assistance. Definitely feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you spot any mistakes.
