Please note that these modification ideas have not been implemented and are purely suggestions that I think may provide a good learning experience and challenge for you as you develop your project. I'd prefer if you genreated your own mod ideas and to unleash your creativity. These are purely just suggsetions.

# Modification suggestoins using components in the kit:
1. "Gamify" your bpm! Create a mini game with the pulse sensor where you need a minimum BPM to clear a stage. This can be kind of a fitness game to improve cardiovascular health.
2. Add code to make it a sleep monitor in which it will record your BPM over a long period of time and graph your BPM as a function of time. You may need to expand the storage with an SD card
3. Use the motor from the kit to provide feedback for your BPM. The faster your BPM, the faster the motor spins. the motor can be attached to a disc that will show a cool pattern when spun fast enough. Be creative!

# Modification suggestions with components purchased from Amazon
1. Purchase an OLED screen and visualize the full heartbeat like in an electrocardiogram. You can then identify the P wave, PR segment, QRS complex, ST segment, and T wave
2. Purchase a piezo buzzer or a speaker to beep in sync with the heartbeat. You can add custom sound effects for certain BPM and change pitch or volume based on BPM. This can be integrated with the game idea where certain sound effects are played for certain BPM thresholds.
3. purchase an ESP32 wifi module to connect the pulse sensor to a locally hosted website where you can check your BPM and where you can store information.
