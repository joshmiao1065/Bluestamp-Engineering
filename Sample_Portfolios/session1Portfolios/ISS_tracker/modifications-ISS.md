Please note that these modification ideas have not been implemented and are purely suggestions that I think may provide a good learning experience and challenge for you as you develop your project. I'd prefer if you genreated your own mod ideas and to unleash your creativity. These are purely just suggsetions.

# Modification suggestoins using components in the kit:
1. Add a message that displays when the ISS is diretly overhead. You'll find a particular coordinate that when the ISS is within maybe 5degrees latitude/longitude, will flash the screen and/or play a sound.
2. Based on the coordinates of the ISS, find out what country or countries the ISS is directly above and maybe display some images of that country. NOte that you may need an SD card to contain all the images since the PyPortal has limited storage.
3. Switch between map types(mercator, mollweide, peters, winkel, etc.) and plot the position of the ISS on these diffrent projection types to show how different 2D projections of the present different kinds of distortion of the world!

# Modification suggestions with components purchased from Amazon
1. This might be a little difficult idk. Purchase a physical map, laser pointer, servos, and materials for an arm. Send real time position data to a servo-based pointer system where you'll move an arm with a laser pointer that will point to a spot on a physical map.
2. get another LCD or OLED display that changes colors, visuals, or imagery based on the ISS' proximity to you.
3. With a 2nd PyPortal or OLED display with a wifi module, display the live view of the earth as steamed from the view of ISS.
