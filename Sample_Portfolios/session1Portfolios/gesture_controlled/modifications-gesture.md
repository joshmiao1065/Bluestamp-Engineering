Please note that these modification ideas have not been implemented and are purely suggestions that I think may provide a good learning experience and challenge for you as you develop your project. I'd prefer if you genreated your own mod ideas and to unleash your creativity. These are purely just suggsetions.

# Modification suggestoins using components in the kit:
1. Integrate the ultrasonic sensor to automatically avoid obstacles and collisions
2. Add a capability to record a series of gestures with the glove to be repeated by the robot on demand.
3. Create an obstacle course for you to navigate around as a challenge of controlling the robot. Continuously tune your parameters for a smoother driving experience.

# Modification suggestions with components purchased from Amazon
1. get a buzzer or a speaker and program a pushbutton to produce a sound similar to honking a horn
2. Get an LCD or OLED display to display the registered command, battery level, communication strnegth, or anything else you might want.
3. Purchase a small camera that can be moutned to the car so that you have a rover which can go into tight spaces and record video.
